This little X utility enables the use of ordinary keys as modifiers.

The original key behavior is maintained under simple key press/release circumstances.

## Strategy

The default keycode (called *natural*) of the original key is mapped to the modifier keysym and the keycode generated by `keydouble` (called *artificial*) under isolated key press/release is mapped to the original keysym.

The mapping is done by `xmodmap` and the *artificial* keycode generation by `keydouble`.

## Configuration

`kdlaunch` honors a configuration file at `~/.keydoublerc` and passes the **natural:artificial** pairs header to `keydouble`.

An example configuration file is provided at `example/keydoublerc`.

If you have a personal `xmodmap` configuration, put it at `~/.xmodmaprc` or change the relevant path in `kdlaunch`.

## Install

Run

    make

Then copy the executables to your `bin` directory.

And add

    kdlaunch &

to `~/.xinitrc`.

To kill `keydouble` run `kdkill`.

## Dependencies

- libxtst
- xorg-xmodmap
- dash

If needed (i.e. if you encounter errors), the `record` X module can be loaded with:

    Section "Module"
        Load "record"
    EndSection
